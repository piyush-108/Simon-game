Simon is an electronic memory game that was first released in the late 1970s. The game consists of a round device with four large, colored buttonsâ€”usually red, blue, green, and yellow. Each button also emits a unique tone when pressed.

How the Game Works:

* Start of the Game: The game starts when the device lights up one of the colored buttons and plays the corresponding tone.

* Player's Turn: The player must press the button that lit up to repeat the sequence.

* Increasing Difficulty: After the player successfully repeats the sequence, Simon adds another light and tone to the sequence, making it progressively harder.

* Objective: The goal is to remember and accurately repeat increasingly long sequences of lights and sounds. The game continues until the player makes a mistake, at which point the game ends.
